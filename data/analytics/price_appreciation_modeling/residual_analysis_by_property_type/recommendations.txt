RESIDUAL ANALYSIS RECOMMENDATIONS BY PROPERTY TYPE
============================================================

HDB:
  • Moderate skewness detected - consider separating resale vs BTO
  • Heavy tails - investigate outliers (possibly unusual transactions)
  • Add town-level features (mature vs non-mature estates)
  • Add proximity to specific amenities (premium malls, top schools)
  • Separate models for different room types (2-room, 3-room, 4-room, 5-room, multi-gen)

Condo:
  • High skewness - separate luxury/mass-market models needed
  • Extreme outliers - handle luxury properties separately
  • Add freehold vs leasehold indicator
  • Add project quality indicators (developer reputation, facilities)
  • Separate models by price segment (mass, mid, luxury)
  • Add strata-titled shophouse detection (different dynamics)

EC:
  • Add proximity to HDB towns (EC buyers often HDB upgraders)
  • Add timing features ( privatisation milestones)
  • Monitor market segment (HDB upgraders vs private condo downgraders)
