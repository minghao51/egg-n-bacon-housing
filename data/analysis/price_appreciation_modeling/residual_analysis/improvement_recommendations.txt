MODEL IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================

• High residual skewness detected. Consider target transformation (log, Box-Cox) or use robust regression models.
• Heavy tails in residuals (extreme errors). Consider separate models for luxury properties or outlier removal.
• Heteroscedasticity detected. Variance increases with fitted values. Use weighted regression or robust standard errors.
• Positive spatial autocorrelation detected. Residuals cluster geographically. Add spatial lag features or regional models.

General Improvements:
• Add polynomial features (squared distances, interaction terms)
• Add more temporal lags (2-year, 3-year)
• Separate models by property type (HDB, Condo, EC)
• Ensemble methods (stacking multiple models)
• Cross-validation with spatial folds (leave-one-area-out)
• Add macroeconomic features (interest rates, policy changes)
