Buying Property
===============

When buying a private residential property, ensure that it does not have any unauthorised works and extensions or is currently not used inappropriately. Otherwise you may be liable for them after taking over the property.

1.  Ask the seller for a copy of approved plans, or
2.  [Submit DC15 - Requisition of Planning Records](https://www.ura.gov.sg/buyplanningrecords) to URA to obtain a copy of the approved plans.

If you are planning to renovate or redevelop after buying the property, you should also check what the approved plans are.

### Key Considerations

[Eligibility](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Buying-Property#Eligibility)

When buying a property, there are many factors to consider and look into.If you own a HDB flat, a DBSS flat or an Executive Condominium, you have to fulfil the minimum occupation period set by HDB before you can purchase any private residential properties.

If you are not a Singapore citizen, you have to obtain approval from the Controller of Residential Property in Singapore Land Authority (SLA), before you can buy landed houses including but not limited to strata landed houses.

[Finances](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Buying-Property#Finances)

Before buying a property, you should check the property prices in the areas of interest and compute your finances and fees payable. You should buy within your financial means.  

### Property prices

We provide [free information](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Property-Data) on the property market, such as prices of private residential units, for you to do your research before purchasing your unit.

### Using your CPF

You may use your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) savings to purchase your private property under the Private Properties Scheme. There are limits on the amount of CPF savings you can use to buy a property. Information on the use of CPF monies is available [here](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tnc/t-c-for-use-of-cpf-under-cpf-housing-scheme "Using your CPF").

### Bank loan

You should enquire with your bank on your eligibility for bank financing as early as possible, preferably before you pay the upfront deposit or commit yourself to the purchase. Before you proceed to check with a bank on the size of your loan, read the [guide on housing loans](https://www.mymoneysense.gov.sg/buying-a-house "guide on housing loan") and other important information.

### Stamp duty

Stamp duty is a tax on dutiable documents relating to any immovable property in Singapore and any stocks or shares. Here are some stamp duty types related to property purchase:

*   **Buyer’s Stamp Duty.** You are required to pay Buyers’ Stamp Duty (BSD) after signing the agreement.
*   **Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty**. You may also need to pay Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty after signing the agreement depending on your profile:

*   Whether you are buying as an individual or as an entity
*   Your residency status e.g. Singaporean
*   Number of residential properties owned  
      
    

*   **Seller’s Stamp Duty.** You may need to pay a Seller’s Stamp Duty (SSD) if you sell or dispose of the property within 4 years of acquisition (for property purchased between 14 Jan 2011 and 10 Mar 2017, both dates inclusive) or within 3 years of acquisition (for property purchase on or after 11 Mar 2017).  
      
    Learn more about stamp duty on [Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Property/ "stamp duty on Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website").

### Legal fees

If you engage a lawyer, you should clarify the scope of services to be provided and the legal fees payable.

[Engaging a property agent](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Residential/Buying-Property#Engaging-property-agent)

 If you engage a property agent to represent you, you should check that property agency and agent are licensed and registered with the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA). Note that property agents are not allowed to offer you any benefit, in cash or kind, to induce you to engage their services. Visit the [CEA website](http://www.cea.gov.sg/consumers/educational-materials/guides-brochures "Council for Estate Agencies (CEA).") for more information on engaging a property agent and the role of an agent in a property transaction.

### Basic Checks

Before committing to a purchase, you should do some basic checks on the developer of the housing project and consider the costs involved in purchasing a private residential property.

### Visiting A Show Flat

At the show flat, review the information on the housing project and specific unit(s) carefully before committing to a purchase. Developers have to ensure that the plans and models displayed, and show units erected are accurate and in accordance with the approved building plans as required under the [Housing Developers (Show Unit) Rules](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/HDCLA1965-S289-2015).

### Booking Your Unit

The developer is required to provide you with a set of mandatory information on the housing project and unit before accepting the booking fee from you. If you decide to proceed with the purchase of the unit after reviewing the information, you will then pay a booking fee for the issue of an [Option to Purchase](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/HDCLA1965-R1?DocDate=20171101&ProvIds=Sc1-.#Sc1-fo2-#Sc1-fo2-) (OTP).

[Download mandatory information and more details on Option to Purchase (OTP).](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Property/Home-Buyers-Guide/Home-Buyers-Guide-3-2024.pdf)

### Signing the Agreement

The [S&PA](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/HDCLA1965-R1?DocDate=20171101&ProvIds=Sc1-.#Sc1-fo4-#Sc1-fo4-) is a private contract between the developer and the purchaser for the sale and purchase of a unit. Licensed housing developers are required to use the standard form of S&PA in the sale of the units in a housing project. No amendment to the S&PA can be made except with the prior approval of the Controller of Housing. You should review the terms in the S&PA before signing it.

### Collecting Your Keys

Once Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) is issued and you have paid the progress payment due upon TOP, the developer will inform you of the procedure to collect the key to your unit. After collecting the key, you can inspect your unit and report any defects in your unit and housing project to the developer to carry out rectification works within the 1 year defects liability period.
