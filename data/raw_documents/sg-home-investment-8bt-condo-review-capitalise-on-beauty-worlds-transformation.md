# 8@BT Condo Review: Capitalise on Beauty World's Transformation | Sg Home Investment
**Who is the Developer of 8@BT?**
---------------------------------

Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited is the developer for 8@BT. It was officially incorporated in Singapore on 27 June 1967. However, its roots trace back to 1911 when it started as a leading rubber company.

The company has a strong reputation in Singapore's real estate market and is known for delivering high-quality residential developments. Their track record and experience add credibility to the 8@BT project, assuring potential buyers of the development's quality and potential.

Some of the projects developed by them include [Liv@MB](https://sghomeinvestment.com/liv-mb-review-condo-near-east-coast-park-new-mrt/ "Liv @ MB Review – Condo Near East Coast Park, New MRT"), [The Atelier](https://sghomeinvestment.com/the-atelier-review-freehold-d9-condo-newton/ "The Atelier Review – Freehold, D9 Condo @ Newton"), Skyline Residences, and Nim Collection, among many others.

**What are the Prices for 8@BT?**
---------------------------------

During the sale launch of 8@BT on 21 September 2024, 83 units (52.5%) were sold at an average price of $2,719 psf, with prices started from $2,530 psf.

This makes 8@BT one of the best new property launches this year – behind the 533-unit Lentor Mansion, which sold 75% of its units at launch in March, and slightly better than Kassia which moved 52% of its units during its launch in July.

99% of the buyers were Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs), with one foreign buyer from the US (who is not subjected to the [60% ABSD](https://sghomeinvestment.com/singapore-hike-absd-rate-doubles-for-foreigners-to-60-percent/ "Singapore Hike ABSD; Rate Doubles For Foreigners to 60 Percent") due to its free trade agreement with Singapore). The majority of buyers were families with children, with an even distribution of other profiles making up the remaining, including a healthy proportion of upgraders and right-sizers.

Based on the sales, 33% of the buyers were between the ages of 31 and 40; 21% were between the ages of 21 and 30; and about 5% were retirees above the age of 60.

The most popular units were the 1-bedroom, with 29 out of the 32 units (91%) sold at prices from $1.338 million. These units have sizes from 517 to 592 sq ft. Equally popular were the 2-bedroom of 624 to 829 sq ft, with 29 (60%) of 48 taken up. These were priced from $1.808 million.

As for the 47 3-bedroom units of 1,001 to 1,270 sq ft, 23 (49%) were sold at prices upward of $2.55 million. Most of the buyers are noted to be owner-occupiers.

Bukit Sembawang clinched the 49,633 sq ft 8@BT site during the government land tender in November 2023 by submitting the highest bid of $200 million. This translates to a land rate of $1,343 psf per plot ratio (ppr).
