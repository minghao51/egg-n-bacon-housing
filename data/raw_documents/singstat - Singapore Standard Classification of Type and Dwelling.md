SINGAPORE STANDARD CLASSIFICATION OF TYPE OF DWELLING 

Introduction 

The Singapore Standard Classification of Type of Dwelling is designed for use in the 

collection of data (e.g. censuses, surveys, administrative records) that requires the 

classification of information on dwelling types. It could also be used in the compilation, 

presentation and analysis of statistics, including economic, social, household and housing 

statistics. The classification provides a common statistical framework that facilitates data -

sharing among producers of statistics, while providing consistent and comparable data to 

users for analysis. 

2 The structure of the standard classification makes reference to the recommendations 

from the Principles and Recom mendations for Population and Housing Censuses (Revision 

2) by the United Nations (UN), with appropriate modifications to take into account 

Singapore’s housing landscape. 

Definition 

3 A dwelling refers to a building or part of a building used or intended to be used by 

one or more persons as living quarters. Each dwelling type has its own separate entrance(s) 

with direct access to a public road or pathway. A dwelling may be a residential building by 

itself or a unit in a residential building, or pa rt of a non -residential building such as a shop or 

factory with space used as living quarters. 

Nature and Principles of the Classification 

4 The principles of the classification serve as guidelines in assigning the most 

appropriate code to a particular dwelling type. At the one -digit level, reported/known dwelling 

types may be categorised as housing units or collective dwellings (see Chart I). 

5 The delineation between housing units and collective dwellings follows the 

recommendation by the UN. Housing units are grouped separately from collective dwellings 

as the implementation of household surveys and housing programmes pertains largely to 

house holds residing in housing units. Housing units comprise Housing and Development 

Board (HDB) properties, landed properties, condominiums and other apartments and other 

housing units which are less commonly found (e.g. housing units with mixed purposes, Singapore Standard Classification of Type of Dwelling Jan 2012

structure unique to local context). Landed properties and condominiums and other 

apartments are grouped by their structure while HDB properties generally follow the category 

assigned by the HDB. Collective dwellings are grouped by their purpose or function. 

Structure of the Classification 

6 The standard classification is a hierarchical structure with three broad categories at 

the highest level, each denoted by a digit, except the ‘Not Reported’ category, which is 

represented by the letter ‘X’. An overview of the structure is depicted in Chart I on pg 4. 

7 In cases where a given level of classification is not divided into categories at the next 

more detailed level of classification, the last digit of the code for the only category at the next 

more detailed level would be ‘0’. For instance, the three -digit co de for ‘Other Collective 

Dwellings nec’ is 290 as it is the only category within the two -digit group, ‘Other Collective 

Dwellings nec’. 

8 The digit ‘9’ in the last digit position denotes a residual group that comprises a 

diverse mix of dwelling types which are not sufficiently significant to justify separate codes. 

This allows all dwelling types, however small or insignificant in number, to be coded using 

this classification. 

Classification of Specific Dwelling Types 

Flats Built by Government Agencies in the Past 

9 Some flats were built by government agencies in the past mainly to provide 

accommodation for their staff. These developments had mostly been sold to private entities 

over the years while some were sold to the HDB or returned to the State. Such fl ats which 

are managed by the HDB are classified under the two -digit group ‘HDB Properties’, 

according to their underlying structure as categorised by the HDB while those which are 

managed by private entities or the State are classified in code 139 ‘Other A partments nec’. Singapore Standard Classification of Type of Dwelling Jan 2012

HUDC Flats 

10 The Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) flats were developed in the 

1970s and 1980s. The development of HUDCs have ceased since 1987. Subject to voting 

by residents, HUDC estates may be privatised to allow residents more control over the 

management of their estates. Privatised HUDC estate s are no longer under the 

management of the HDB and are classified in code 139 ‘Other Apartments nec’. Those 

which have not been privatised are classified in code 117 ‘HUDC Flat’ under the two -digit 

group ‘HDB Properties’. 

Executive Condominiums 

11 The Exec utive Condominiums (ECs) housing scheme was launched in 1996. ECs 

are developed and sold by private developers, boasting facilities and designs comparable to 

private condominiums, with some restrictions imposed by HDB for a period of time. All ECs 

are cla ssified in code 132 ‘Executive Condominium’ under the ‘Housing Units’ category. 

Flats under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) 

12 To enable HDB housing to be more responsive and meet the needs and aspirations 

of Singaporeans, the DBSS was launched to bring about greater innovation in building and 

design and to offer more housing choices to the public by involving the private sector in the 

development and design of public housing. The flats under this scheme are subject to the 

HDB’s rules and are classi fied based on their underlying structure (e.g. 4 -room, 5 -room HDB 

flat). Two Digits  One Digit
