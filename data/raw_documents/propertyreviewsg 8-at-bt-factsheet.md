### Caution reigns at state land tenders, despite developers’ low unsold private housing inventory

AN AIR of caution prevailed at the latest government land sales (GLS) tender closings for two 99-year leasehold private housing sites near Beauty World and Hillview MRT stations.

The number of bids received was below market expectations.

However, the top bids for both plots came in within the range of expectations indicated by property consultants polled by _The Business Times_ before the tenders for the two sites closed on Thursday (Nov 3).

The Hillview Rise site, which can generate about 335 homes, received four bids. A partnership between Far East Organization and Sekisui House placed the top bid of S$320.78 million, or nearly S$1,024 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr).

The site along Bukit Timah Link, a stone’s throw from Beauty World MRT station, fetched five bids.

Bukit Sembawang Estates’ top bid of S$200 million or S$1,343.13 psf ppr was 15.7 per cent more than the second-highest bid from Wing Tai.

URA Master Plan of Bukit Timah Link GLS, showing plot ratio of 3.0 on a Residential only land plot

### Bukit Timah Link GLS Street View

### Bukit Timah Link GLS Planning Concept

The Land Parcel is located within the Beauty World precinct, at the junction of Jalan Jurong Kechil and Jalan Anak Bukit. At the 7 th Mile along Bukit Timah Road, the Beauty World precinct has evolved from a local village centre to an urban village with 2-storey shophouses lining Cheong Chin Nam Road, Chun Tin Road and Jalan Jurong Kechil, as well as shopping centres along Upper Bukit Timah Road. Today, the area offers a variety of retail and food and beverage amenities in close proximity to Beauty World MRT Station.

As one of Singapore’s endearing identity nodes, Beauty World is envisioned as a green urban village that will serve as the centre of community life and the southern gateway into Bukit Timah’s nature attractions. The Rail Corridor, Coast-to-Coast trail and upcoming Rifle Range Nature Park will be complemented by public and private development projects 1 that will facilitate the area’s rejuvenation and add to its overall vibrancy. Cycling paths will also be introduced as part of the comprehensive cycling network to connect the area to the existing Park Connector Network and Rail Corridor.

Set against the backdrop of Bukit Timah Hill and the upcoming naturebased projects, the proposed development is envisioned to be lushly landscaped to contribute towards the overall sense of greenery in the area.

The rejuvenation of Beauty World will be carried out progressively, through both upcoming public and private development projects, including the upcoming new Bukit Timah Community Building, Jalan Anak Bukit Integrated Transport Hub, and The Linq@Beauty World (previously known as Goh and Goh Building).
