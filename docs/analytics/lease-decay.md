# Lease Decay Impact on Singapore HDB Resale Prices

**Analysis Date**: February 4, 2026
**Data Period**: 2017-2026 (full dataset)
**Property Types**: HDB only
**Status**: Complete

---

## 📋 Key Takeaways

### 💡 The One Big Insight

**Lease decay is not linear** - the 70-80 year band shows the steepest price decline (21.9% discount, 0.93% annual decay), contradicting simple straight-line depreciation models. Market prices deviate dramatically from theoretical valuation curves, especially for older leases that trade 400-1700% above their theoretical value.

### 🎯 What This Means For You

- **For Investors**: The 60-70 year band offers the best value opportunity - 23.8% discount with highest liquidity (24.4% of transaction volume). The pure lease effect is +$54.75 PSF per additional year after controlling for location.

- **For First-Time Buyers**: Don't avoid shorter leases automatically - 60-70 year properties offer significant savings (23.8% discount) with strong market liquidity. The 70-80 year "maturity cliff" offers the steepest discounts but consider upcoming maintenance costs.

- **For Upsizers**: If you're selling a 90+ year lease HDB, you'll capture a 22% premium vs shorter leases. Target the 60-70 year band for your upgrade to maximize value while maintaining liquidity.

### ✅ Action Steps

1. Check remaining lease before buying - 90+ years optimal (peak pricing), 70-80 years maximum discount
2. Verify CPF eligibility - remaining lease must cover youngest buyer to age 95
3. Calculate the pure lease effect - +$54.75 PSF per additional year (after controlling for location)
4. Consider location-lease interaction - same lease difference commands 38.9% discount in Queenstown vs -20.2% premium in Pasir Ris
5. Monitor the "maturity cliff" - 70-80 year band has steepest decay (0.93% annually) due to HIP costs

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines how remaining lease duration affects HDB resale prices using **223,634 transactions** (2017-2026). The findings reveal a **non-linear relationship** between lease remaining and property value, with substantial price discounts for aging leases and counter-intuitive transaction patterns.

**Key Finding**: Lease decay is not a smooth straight-line decline. The **70-80 year band shows the steepest discount** (21.9% vs 90+ years) with the highest annual decay rate (0.93%), creating a "maturity cliff" effect. Despite this discount, the **60-70 year band has the highest transaction volume** (24.4% of all transactions), indicating strong value-seeking buyer demand.

### Three Critical Insights

1. **Lease Decay is Non-Linear** - The 70-80 year band shows peak decay (21.9% discount, 0.93% annual rate), while the <60 year band shows lower decay (0.34%) due to location premium effects. Straight-line depreciation models are inaccurate.

2. **Location Moderates Lease Decay** - The same lease difference (60 vs 90 years) commands dramatically different prices across towns: **Queenstown** (38.9% discount) vs **Pasir Ris** (-20.2% premium for shorter leases). Town selection is as important as lease remaining.

3. **Market Overvalues Older Leases** - Compared to Bala's theoretical valuation curve, the HDB market overvalues older leases by **+12.66% on average**, with 40-year leases trading **49.6% above theoretical value**. This suggests buyers price in SERS expectations and location premiums.

## Core Findings

### 1. Price Impact by Lease Band

The most fundamental finding is the **non-linear relationship** between remaining lease and property value.

**Lease Band Summary:**

| Lease Band | Avg Remaining Years | Median Price | Median PSF | Discount vs 90+ yrs | Annual Decay Rate | Transactions |
|------------|--------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **90+ years** | 93.5 years | $558,000 | **$6,205** | baseline | 0.00% | 50,912 |
| **80-90 years** | 84.6 years | $520,000 | $5,389 | -13.2% | 0.92% | 29,562 |
| **70-80 years** | 75.4 years | $548,000 | $4,845 | **-21.9%** | **0.93%** | 47,044 |
| **60-70 years** | 64.6 years | $446,000 | $4,730 | **-23.8%** | 0.69% | **54,521** |
| **<60 years** | 54.5 years | $390,000 | $5,274 | -15.0% | 0.34% | 41,595 |

<Tooltip term="Annual Decay Rate">
The percentage price decline per year as remaining lease shortens. Calculated as: discount_to_baseline / (99 - avg_remaining_lease_years). Higher values = faster price decline.
</Tooltip>

**Key Observations:**

- **Non-linear discounts**: The 70-80 year band shows the highest discount (21.9%), not the <60 year band (15.0%)
- **Highest transaction volume**: 60-70 year band comprises 24.4% of all transactions despite the 23.8% discount
- **PSF inversion**: <60 year band has higher PSF ($5,274) than 70-80 year band ($4,845) - likely due to smaller flat sizes in desirable locations

---

### 2. The "Maturity Cliff" - 70-80 Year Decay Peak

The most surprising finding is the **accelerated decay in the 70-80 year band**, contradicting simple linear depreciation models.

**The Maturity Cliff Phenomenon:**

| Lease Band | Annual Decay Rate | Discount vs 90+ yrs | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **70-80 years** | **0.93%** | **-21.9%** | Peak decay - "Maturity Cliff" |
| 60-70 years | 0.69% | -23.8% | High volume, value seekers |
| <60 years | 0.34% | -15.0% | Location premium offsets decay |
| 80-90 years | 0.92% | -13.2% | Pre-cliff stability |
| 90+ years | 0.00% | baseline | Optimal pricing |

**Why the 70-80 Year Band Peaks:**

The 70-80 year band corresponds to flats completed around **1997** (28-29 years old). This creates a "perfect storm" of factors:

1. **Physical Depreciation Compounding**
   - 28-year-old buildings show visible wear
   - Maintenance costs starting to accumulate
   - Buyer perception of "old" kicks in

2. **HIP (Home Improvement Programme) Costs**
   - HIP occurs at 20-30 years of age
   - Recent HIP completion may have imposed special assessments
   - Buyers factoring in future maintenance liabilities

3. **Buyer Pool Shift**
   - Young families avoiding "old" flats for long-term holds
   - Investment-oriented buyers targeting shorter holding periods
   - Downsizing seniors avoiding large units

<ImplicationBox persona="investor">
**For Property Investors:**

The 60-70 year band offers the best risk-reward balance: significant discounts (23.8%) with highest liquidity (24.4% of transaction volume).

✅ **What to Do:**
- Target 60-70 year lease band for optimal value + liquidity
- Expect 0.69% annual decay - factor this into hold period projections
- Focus on locations where 60-70 year leases have smallest discount vs 90+ years (Pasir Ris, Serangoon, Bishan)
- Calculate pure lease effect: +$54.75 PSF per additional year = $5,475 added value per 100 sqft per extra lease year
- Avoid 70-80 year band unless pricing reflects 0.93% annual decay rate
- Consider <60 year band only for location premium (mature estates like Queenstown)

❌ **What to Avoid:**
- Assuming linear decay - 70-80 year band has 0.93% rate vs <60 year band 0.34%
- Overpaying for 70-80 year leases without accounting for HIP costs
- Ignoring location-lease interaction - same lease difference varies 59% across towns
- Neglecting CPF restrictions - remaining lease must cover youngest buyer to age 95

💰 **ROI Impact:**
- 60-70 year band: 23.8% discount = $133K savings on $560K property (90+ year baseline)
- Pure lease effect: Each additional year = +$54.75 PSF (1000 sqft × $54.75 = $54,750 added value per year)
- **Investment Strategy**: Buy in 60-70 year band at discount, hold 5-10 years, exit to value-seeking buyers (24.4% market volume ensures liquidity)

### 3. Location Moderates Lease Decay

The most counter-intuitive finding: **the same lease difference commands vastly different prices across locations**.

**Town-Specific Normalization (Short vs Fresh Lease Within Same Town):**

| Town | Short Lease (PSM) | Fresh Lease (PSM) | Discount % | Interpretation |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **CLEMENTI** | $5,224 | $8,796 | **40.6%** | Mature estate, strong lease effect |
| **TOA PAYOH** | $4,939 | $8,182 | **39.6%** | Prime location, high lease sensitivity |
| **QUEENSTOWN** | $5,526 | $9,048 | **38.9%** | Prime mature estate |
| **ANG MO KIO** | $4,877 | $7,455 | **34.6%** | Established neighborhood |
| **BUKIT MERAH** | $5,565 | $8,500 | **34.5%** | Central region premium |
| **CENTRAL AREA** | $6,917 | $10,168 | **32.0%** | CBD location |
| **WOODLANDS** | $4,262 | $4,544 | **6.2%** | OCR, minimal lease effect |
| **JURONG WEST** | $4,496 | $4,516 | **0.4%** | Suburban, lease irrelevant |
| **CHOA CHU KANG** | $4,615 | $4,570 | **-1.0%** | Negative discount (premium) |
| **HOUGANG** | $5,177 | $5,026 | **-3.0%** | Short leases worth more |
| **TAMPINES** | $5,413 | $4,959 | **-9.2%** | Negative discount persists |
| **YISHUN** | $5,079 | $4,522 | **-12.3%** | Strong location premium |
| **BISHAN** | $6,985 | $6,105 | **-14.4%** | Short leases command premium |
| **SERANGOON** | $5,929 | $5,085 | **-16.6%** | Location outweighs lease |
| **PASIR RIS** | $5,621 | $4,676 | **-20.2%** | Short leases worth 20% MORE |

**What This Means:**

- **High Discount Towns (30-40%):** Mature estates (Clementi, Toa Payoh, Queenstown) where buyers demand steep discounts for shorter leases
- **Negative Discount Towns (-20% to 0%):** Suburban areas (Pasir Ris, Serangoon, Yishun) where location premium outweighs lease decay - short leases command MORE than fresh leases

<Scenario title="First-Time Buyer Choosing Between Lease Bands">
**Situation:** You're a first-time buyer evaluating two similar 4-room HDB flats in different towns:

- **Property A**: Queenstown, 65-year remaining lease, $500K, 95 sqm
- **Property B**: Pasir Ris, 95-year remaining lease, $520K, 95 sqm
- Both similar condition, same floor level

**Our Analysis Says:**
- **Queenstown Lease Effect**: 38.9% within-town discount for short leases
- **Pasir Ris Lease Effect**: -20.2% within-town premium for short leases
- **Pure Lease Effect**: +$54.75 PSF per additional year = 30 years × $54.75 = +$1,642 PSM
- **Implied Price Adjustment**: 30 years × $1,642 = $156K for 95 sqm

**Your Decision Framework:**

1. **Calculate True Discount**: Queenstown property should be $156K cheaper due to lease, not $20K
2. **Verify Location Premium**: Queenstown location worth $126K more than Pasir Ris?
3. **Assess Holding Period**: 65-year lease = enough for 30-year hold with 35 years remaining for resale
4. **Check CPF Eligibility**: 65 years > (95 - your_age) for most buyers under 30

**Bottom Line**: **Property A (Queenstown) offers exceptional value.** The 30-year lease difference should create $156K price gap, but actual gap is only $20K. You're getting prime location (Queenstown) at essentially the same effective price as suburban Pasir Ris when lease-adjusted. The 65-year remaining lease is sufficient for long-term holding (30 years + 35 years for resale).

</Scenario>

<Scenario title="Investor Evaluating 60-70 Year Lease Band">
**Situation:** You're a value-focused investor considering a 4-room HDB with 65-year remaining lease:

- **Property**: Ang Mo Kio, 65-year lease, 95 sqm, $450K
- **Comparable**: Same town, 90+ year lease, $590K (23.8% premium)
- **Your Plan**: Buy, rent out for 5 years, then sell

**Our Analysis Says:**
- **Discount Captured**: 23.8% = $140K savings upfront
- **Annual Decay**: 0.69% for 60-70 year band = 3.45% over 5-year hold
- **Pure Lease Effect**: 25 years difference × $54.75 PSF/year = $1,368 PSM = $130K total
- **Liquidity**: 60-70 year band = 24.4% of transaction volume (highest liquidity)
- **Rental Yield**: $450K purchase vs $2,200/month rent = 5.9% gross yield

**Your Decision Framework:**

1. **Verify Discount**: $140K upfront savings exceeds expected decay ($450K × 3.45% = $15.5K)
2. **Check Exit Liquidity**: 24.4% market volume ensures buyers when you sell in 5 years
3. **Calculate Total Return**: $140K discount - $15.5K decay + $15.5K appreciation (5% × 5 years) = $140K net gain
4. **Assess Rental Demand**: Ang Mo Kio mature town = strong rental demand

**Bottom Line**: **Buy this property.** The $140K upfront discount (23.8%) dramatically exceeds the expected decay over 5 years ($15.5K). Even with zero appreciation, you capture $124K net gain. High market liquidity (24.4% volume) ensures exit flexibility. Rental yield of 5.9% provides cash flow during holding period.

</Scenario>

### 4. Market Deviation from Theoretical Valuation

The analysis compared empirical HDB prices against **Bala's curve** - the standard professional valuation framework for leasehold properties.

**Deviation Summary:**

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Years Analyzed | 58 (40-97 years) |
| Average Deviation | **+12.66%** |
| Maximum Deviation | +49.62% (40-year lease) |
| Minimum Deviation | -21.34% (84-year lease) |
| Overvalued Years | 34 of 58 (59%) |
| Undervalued Years | 10 of 58 (17%) |

**Key Deviations:**

| Lease Years | Empirical % | Theoretical % | Deviation % | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **40 years** | 89.6% | 40.0% | **+49.6%** | Massive overvaluation |
| **50 years** | 83.6% | 50.0% | **+33.6%** | Strong overvaluation |
| **60 years** | 81.2% | 60.0% | **+21.2%** | Significant premium |
| **70 years** | 73.1% | 70.0% | **+3.1%** | Slight premium |
| **78-84 years** | 65-73% | 78-88% | **-7% to -21%** | Undervaluation band |
| **90 years** | 105.3% | 95.0% | **+10.3%** | Fresh lease premium |

<Tooltip term="Bala's Curve">
Standard professional valuation table for leasehold properties. Shows theoretical value as percentage of freehold based on remaining lease. Used by surveyors and valuers for property assessment.
</Tooltip>

**What This Means:**

The HDB market **consistently overvalues older leases** compared to theoretical valuation models. A 40-year lease trades 49.6% above its theoretical value - suggesting buyers price in:

1. **Location Premium**: Older leases in mature estates (Queenstown, Tiong Bahru)
2. **SERS Expectations**: Anticipated government land acquisition at premium prices
3. **Affordability-Driven Demand**: Value-seekers targeting discounted older leases
4. **Behavioral Bias**: Buyers underestimate lease decay risk

---

### 5. Policy Thresholds: The 60-Year CPF Boundary

Singapore's CPF system restricts usage for properties with **less than 60 years remaining lease** - the lease must cover the youngest buyer to age 95.

**Empirical Evidence:**

| Metric | 60+ Years | <60 Years | Gap | Statistical Significance |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|--------------------------|
| Median PSM | $5,192 | $5,274 | -1.57% | p = 0.28 (not significant) |

**Key Finding**: Contrary to expectations, the <60 year band shows **slightly higher PSF** ($5,274 vs $5,192). This suggests:

- Market efficiently prices the financing constraint
- Other factors (location, flat type) dominate valuation
- The 60-year rule affects **cashflow** (no CPF) more than **price**
- No significant price discontinuity exists at this policy boundary

**Liquidity Analysis (61 vs 59 years):**

| Lease Years | Median PSM | Transactions | % of Total |
|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 61 years | $5,216 | 5,436 | 2.4% |
| 60 years | $5,286 | 6,239 | 2.8% |
| 59 years | $5,234 | 4,980 | 2.2% |

**Liquidity Tax: ~0%** - The expected "discount" for crossing the 60-year threshold is negligible.

## Investment Implications

### For Property Buyers

**Lease Band Strategy:**

| Strategy | Lease Band | Discount | Liquidity | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Maximum value** | 60-70 years | -23.8% | 24.4% (highest) | Budget-conscious buyers |
| **Balanced choice** | 70-80 years | -21.9% | 21.0% | Value seekers willing to accept HIP costs |
| **Long-term hold** | 90+ years | baseline | 22.8% | Multi-generational wealth transfer |
| **Location arbitrage** | <60 years | -15.0% | 18.6% | Prime locations at discount |

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Match Lease to Holding Period**: 30-year hold requires 60+ years remaining for comfortable exit
2. **CPF Usage Rules**: Remaining lease must cover youngest buyer to age 95
3. **Location-Lease Interaction**: Same lease difference varies 59% across towns (Clementi 40.6% vs Pasir Ris -20.2%)
4. **Financing Constraints**: Bank LTV limits may apply for leases below 60 years

### For Property Investors

**Yield Optimization:**

**Focus:** 60-70 year lease band
- **Highest market liquidity** (24.4% of transaction volume)
- **23.8% discount** vs 90+ year baseline = $133K savings on $560K property
- **Lower purchase price** = higher potential rental yield (5.5-6.5% gross yield achievable)
- **Exit strategy**: Multiple buyers in this segment support resale liquidity

**Appreciation Potential:**

**Focus:** 90+ year lease band
- **Lowest annual decay rate** (0.00%)
- **Strong demand** from long-term owner-occupiers
- **Generational hold potential** for wealth preservation
- **Premium pricing** persists despite higher entry cost

**Pure Lease Effect:**

After controlling for location, size, and floor via hedonic regression:
- **+$54.75 PSF per additional lease year**
- 1000 sqft × $54.75 = **$54,750 added value per extra lease year**
- 30-year difference = **$1.64M total value difference** (all else equal)

**Risk Factors:**

| Risk | Lease Band | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Exit liquidity** | <60 years | Target shorter holding periods; verify buyer demand |
| **Financing risk** | 60-70 years | Confirm bank LTV limits; ensure CPF eligibility |
| **Decay acceleration** | 70-80 years | Factor in 0.93% annual decay; price conservatively |
| **Location confounding** | All bands | Use town-normalized comparisons; pure lease effect = $54.75 PSF/year |
