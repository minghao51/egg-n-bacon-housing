# Price Appreciation Prediction

**Analysis Date**: February 17, 2026
**Data Period**: 2021-2026 (Post-COVID recovery)
**Property Types**: HDB, Condominium, Executive Condo
**Status**: Complete

---

## 📋 Key Takeaways

### 💡 The One Big Insight

**Predictability varies dramatically by property type** - HDB and EC prices are highly predictable (80-99% accuracy with 97-99% directional accuracy), while luxury condos are fundamentally unpredictable (30% accuracy, ±1076% confidence interval). One model does not fit all.

### 🎯 What This Means For You

- **For Investors**: Use HDB and mass market condo predictions with high confidence (85-99% accuracy). Avoid relying on luxury condo predictions - they're too uncertain (±1076% CI) for practical investment decisions.

- **For First-Time Buyers**: HDB predictions are highly reliable (99.4% directional accuracy, ±18.6% CI) - you can trust the direction of price changes when planning your purchase timing.

- **For Upsizers**: Use HDB sale predictions with confidence (99.4% directional accuracy), but be cautious with condo purchase predictions - verify mass market segment qualifies (&lt;1500 PSF) for reliable guidance.

### ✅ Action Steps

1. Check property segment first - HDB/EC = high confidence, luxury = unreliable
2. Always verify confidence intervals - if >±100%, treat as trend indicator only
3. For condos, confirm price PSF segment - mass market (&lt;1500 PSF) is reliable, luxury (>$3000 PSF) is not
4. Use momentum as your primary signal - 2-year historical appreciation explains 51-66% of prediction power

### 📊 By The Numbers











---

## Executive Summary

We built a **smart prediction system** that can forecast how much Singapore property prices will change over the next year (YoY appreciation). The system is **74% accurate** overall and can predict the *direction* of price changes correctly **97% of the time**.

**Key Finding**: Different property types behave very differently. A unified model achieved only 47% accuracy, while intelligent segmentation (using specialized models for each property type) reached 74% accuracy - a **58% improvement**.

### Three Critical Insights

1. **One Model Doesn't Fit All** - Different property types require different models. The unified model achieved 47% accuracy, while the smart ensemble reached 74% by routing each property to its best model.

2. **Government-Regulated Segments Are Highly Predictable** - HDB (80% accuracy, 99% directional) and EC (99% accuracy, 97% directional) show high reliability due to policy constraints and market structure.

3. **Condo Heterogeneity Requires Segmentation** - A single condo model performed poorly (32% accuracy). Segmenting by price tier dramatically improved results: mass market (86%) vs luxury (30%).

## Core Findings

### 1. Model Performance by Segment

The most important finding is that **predictability varies dramatically by property type and price segment**.

**Quick Summary Table:**

| Segment | Accuracy (R²) | Error Margin | 95% CI Width | Directional Acc | Reliability |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **HDB flats** | 79.8% | ±6.69% | ±18.58% | 99.4% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High |
| **Executive Condos (EC)** | 98.5% | ±4.57% | ±50.15% | 97.1% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **Mass Market Condos** (&lt;1500 psf) | 85.6% | ±6.70% | ±40.48% | 96.4% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **Mid Market Condos** ($1500-3000 psf) | 72.6% | ±93.37% | ±1877.88% | 94.2% | ⭐⭐ Low |
| **Luxury Condos** (>$3000 psf) | 30.1% | ±83.80% | ±1076.24% | 92.3% | ⭐ Very Low |



**What This Means:**

- **HDB and EC**: Highly reliable - safe for investment decisions
- **Mass Market Condos**: Reliable - use with moderate confidence
- **Mid Market Condos**: Caution - use as rough guidance only
- **Luxury Condos**: Do not rely on predictions - expert validation required

**Sample Sizes:**
- HDB: 176,523 training samples, 76,387 test samples (large, reliable)
- EC: 15,075 training samples, 10,014 test samples (smaller but highly predictable)
- Condos: 103,769 training samples, 70,291 test samples (segmented into 3 tiers)

### 2. Confidence Intervals: Understanding Uncertainty

Confidence intervals quantify prediction uncertainty - they tell you the range where we're 95% confident the actual value will fall.

**95% Confidence Interval by Segment:**

| Segment | 95% CI Width | Actual Coverage | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **HDB** | ±18.58% | 95.2% | Well-calibrated uncertainty, safe for decisions |
| **EC** | ±50.15% | 95.2% | Wider but reliable, good for portfolio planning |
| **Mass Market** | ±40.48% | 95.0% | Moderate uncertainty, use with caution |
| **Mid Market** | ±1877.88% | 95.2% | Extremely wide - use as directional indicator only |
| **Luxury** | ±1076.24% | 95.3% | Extremely wide - not practically useful |



**Practical Example:**

- **HDB Prediction**: +5.2% appreciation with 95% CI [+2.1%, +11.5%]
  - **Interpretation**: We're 95% confident actual appreciation will be between 2.1% and 11.5%
  - **Action**: Safe to use for investment planning

- **Luxury Condo Prediction**: +15.2% appreciation with 95% CI [-894%, +182%]
  - **Interpretation**: The interval is meaningless - includes both massive loss and massive gain
  - **Action**: Do not rely on prediction; expert validation required

| 2 | **Transaction count** | 14.75% | Market activity indicates demand |
| 3 | **Trend stability** | 9.81% | Stable trends = more predictable |
| 4 | **Stratified median price** | 5.51% | Area-specific benchmarks matter |
| 5 | **3-month avg volume** | 3.52% | Recent market liquidity |

**Mass Market Condo Model** (Top 5):

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|------|---------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | **2-year YoY appreciation** | 65.50% | Extremely strong historical signal |
| 2 | **12-month avg volume** | 10.44% | Annual market activity baseline |
| 3 | **Trend stability** | 6.38% | Predictability factor |
| 4 | **Transaction count** | 5.57% | Demand indicator |
| 5 | **Stratified median price** | 4.09% | Area benchmarks |

**Key Pattern**: The 2-year historical appreciation (`yoy_change_pct_lag2`) accounts for **51-66% of prediction power** across all segments.

## Decision Framework

### Should You Trust the Prediction?

```
├─ Is it HDB or EC?
│  └─ YES → High confidence (97-99% directional accuracy)
│     → Use for investment decisions
│     → Check confidence interval (±18-50%)
│
├─ Is it Mass Market Condo (&lt;1500 psf)?
│  └─ YES → Good confidence (96% directional accuracy)
│     → Use for investment guidance
│     → Check confidence interval (±40%)
│
├─ Is it Mid Market Condo ($1500-3000 psf)?
│  └─ CAUTION → Moderate confidence (94% directional accuracy)
│     → Use as rough trend indicator
│     → Confidence interval extremely wide (±1878%)
│     → Always supplement with additional research
│
└─ Is it Luxury Condo (>$3000 psf)?
   └─ DON'T RELY → Low confidence (92% directional accuracy)
      → Use only as screening tool
      → Confidence interval unusable (±1076%)
      → Expert validation required
```

### Risk Management Guidelines

| Reliability Level | Segments | Action |
|-------------------|----------|--------|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **High** | HDB, EC, Mass Market | Use predictions directly for investment decisions. Check confidence intervals for risk assessment. |
| ⭐⭐⭐ **Medium** | - | Use as one input among many. Supplement with location research, market analysis. |
| ⭐⭐ **Low** | Mid Market | Use as rough trend indicator only. Always conduct additional due diligence. |
| ⭐ **Very Low** | Luxury | Do not rely on predictions. Expert validation mandatory. |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Using mass market model for luxury condos**
- **Result**: Massive errors (±83% MAE), unusable confidence intervals
- **Fix**: Always verify price segment (PSF threshold) before interpreting predictions

❌ **Ignoring confidence intervals**
- **Result**: False precision in predictions, underestimating risk
- **Fix**: Always check 95% CI width. If >±100%, treat predictions skeptically

❌ **Assuming past = future**
- **Result**: Predictions may fail during market regime shifts (policy changes, economic shocks)
- **Fix**: Use as probability estimates, not guarantees. Monitor market conditions.

❌ **Over-relying on directional accuracy**
- **Result**: Missing the magnitude of potential gains/losses
- **Fix**: For high-confidence segments (HDB, EC), directional accuracy is reliable. For low-confidence segments (luxury), even direction is uncertain.

## Methodology Overview

### Data Sources & Coverage

| Dimension | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Total Transactions** | 1.1M | HDB (253K), Condo (174K), EC (25K) |
| **Time Period** | 2021-2026 | Post-COVID recovery period only |
| **Geographic Coverage** | Nationwide Singapore | All planning areas |
| **Property Types** | HDB, Condominium, EC | Public and private housing |
| **Target Variable** | YoY Appreciation % | Year-over-year price change |

**Important Limitation**: Data is limited to 2021-2026 (post-COVID). Pre-pandemic patterns may differ significantly.

### Modeling Approach

**Smart Ensemble Structure**:
- 5 specialized XGBoost regressors
- 200-300 trees per model
- Max depth: 6-8 levels
- Learning rate: 0.1
- Routes each property to its best model based on type and price segment

**Model Comparison**:

| Model | R² | MAE | Improvement |
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Baseline (Unified XGBoost) | 0.468 | ±58.45% | - |
| Property-Type Models (HDB/Condo/EC) | 0.374 | ±56.67% | -20% worse |
| **Smart Ensemble (Final)** | **0.739** | **±36.12%** | **+58% better** |

**Key Insight**: Intelligent segmentation dramatically outperforms one-size-fits-all approaches.

### Key Features Used

**Top Features by Importance**:

| Feature Category | Examples | Typical Importance |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Historical Performance** | 2-year YoY appreciation | 51-66% (TOP PREDICTOR) |
| **Market Activity** | Transaction count, volume | 5-15% |
| **Trend Stability** | Rolling standard deviation | 6-10% |
| **Location Benchmarks** | Stratified median price | 4-6% |
| **Spatial Features** | MRT distance, amenities | 1-3% |

**The Power of Momentum**: The 2-year historical appreciation rate is consistently the #1 predictor across ALL property types, accounting for more than half of prediction power.

## Limitations & Considerations

### Data Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **Post-2021 only** | May not represent pre-COVID patterns | Treat as post-pandemic baseline; don't extrapolate to earlier periods |
| **No causal inference** | Correlations ≠ causation | Use predictions, not explanations; be cautious about policy implications |
| **EC small sample** | Only 25K records vs 253K HDB | Higher confidence in HDB predictions; EC results may not generalize |
| **Temporal changes** | Models don't auto-update | Refresh models quarterly with new data |

### When NOT To Trust Predictions

❌ **Avoid using for:**
- Luxury condos (>$3000 psf) - too unpredictable
- Mid-market condos with extreme values - ±1878% CI is unusable
- Market regime shifts (e.g., new cooling measures, interest rate shocks)
- Individual properties with unique features (penthouse, special views, landmark status)

✅ **Safe to use for:**
- HDB flats (any town, any size) - 99.4% directional accuracy
- Executive Condos - 97.1% directional accuracy
- Mass market condos (&lt;1500 psf) - 96.4% directional accuracy
- Portfolio-level planning (aggregation reduces error)
