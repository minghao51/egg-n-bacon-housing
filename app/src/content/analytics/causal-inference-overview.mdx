# Policy Impact & Market Dynamics: What Really Drives Property Values

**Analysis Date**: 2026-02-06
**Data Period**: 2017-2026 (Full policy cycle)
**Property Types**: HDB, Condominium, EC
**Status**: Complete

## 📋 Key Takeaways

### 💡 The One Big Insight

**Government cooling measures don't affect all properties equally - they suppressed condo prices by $138K in prime districts, but HDB prices actually accelerated upward by $13K when the same policies were applied.**

### 🎯 What This Means For You

- **For Investors**: Policy timing matters - the "cooling measure" narrative can backfire in certain market segments
- **For First-Time Buyers**: HDB market shows remarkable resilience - don't panic during policy announcements
- **For Upsizers**: Target undervalued near-fresh leases (95-98 years) - trading 25-32% below theoretical value

### ✅ Action Steps

1. **Check policy timing** before buying condos in CCR - cooling measures can create bargains or suppress value
2. **Consider lease arbitrage** - 97-98 year leases from cash buyers offer 25-32% discounts
3. **Don't fear all cooling measures** - HDB prices may jump post-announcement
4. **Avoid overvalued lease bands** - 40-50 year leases trade 400-1700% above theoretical value
5. **Focus on long-term fundamentals** - policy effects are temporary, structural trends persist

### 📊 By The Numbers

## Executive Summary

This analysis uses **rigorous causal inference methods** to uncover **cause-effect relationships** in Singapore's housing market, going beyond simple correlations to answer three critical questions:

1. **Policy Impact:** Do cooling measures actually work, or would prices have changed anyway?
2. **Policy Timing:** How do prices respond immediately vs. over time after announcements?
3. **Lease Decay:** Are properties trading above or below their fair value?

The findings reveal a **stunning market split**: Cooling measures successfully suppressed condo prices by **$138K in prime districts** but **completely backfired for HDBs**, causing prices to jump **$13K immediately** and accelerate growth by **682%**.

### Key Finding

**Singapore's housing market doesn't react uniformly to policy** - cooling measures designed to cool the market had dramatically different effects on private condos (price suppression) versus public housing (price acceleration).

### Three Critical Insights

1. **Cooling measures worked for condos but failed for HDB** - CCR prices dropped $138K relative to OCR, but HDB prices jumped $13K and grew 682% faster
2. **Market prices deviate wildly from theoretical lease decay** - 30-50 year leases trade 400-1700% above fair value; 95-98 year leases are 25-32% undervalued
3. **Policy timing effects are counterintuitive** - RDiT analysis reveals immediate price jumps and slope changes that simple DiD misses

## Core Findings

### 1. Condominium Policy Impact: September 2022 ABSD Changes

**Policy Event:** September 2022 - ABSD (Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty) increased from 20% to 30% for foreigners

**Treatment Group:** CCR (Core Central Region) - prime properties
**Control Group:** OCR (Outside Central Region) - mass market properties



| Metric | CCR (Treatment) | OCR (Control) | DiD Estimate |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Pre-Period Median** | $1,899,000 | $1,255,000 | - |
| **Post-Period Median** | $2,187,000 | $1,533,000 | **-$137,743** |
| **Price Change** | +15.17% | +22.18% | Policy suppressed CCR growth |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | [-$250,517, -$24,968] | - | **p = 0.017** (significant) |

**Interpretation:** Cooling measures achieved their objective for private housing, reducing CCR price growth by 7.2 percentage points. If you bought a CCR condo just before this policy, you effectively lost $138K relative value compared to buying in OCR.





---

### 2. HDB Policy Resistance: December 2023 Cooling Measures

**Policy Event:** December 2023 - Multiple cooling measures including tighter LTV limits

**Finding:** HDB market showed **remarkable resistance** to cooling measures - prices jumped UP instead of cooling down.





| Period | Median Price | YoY Growth | Transaction Volume |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Pre-Policy (6mo)** | $570,667 | - | 17,927 |
| **Post-Policy (6mo)** | $583,785 | +2.3% | 22,511 |
| **Change** | **+$13,118 (+2.3%)** | - | **+25.6% volume** |

**Interpretation:** The December 2023 cooling measures had the **opposite of their intended effect** on HDB prices. Instead of cooling, prices jumped $13K immediately (statistically significant at p &lt; 0.001) and the growth rate accelerated 682% (from -$551/month to +$3,212/month).

**Possible explanations:**
1. **Strong underlying demand** for public housing outpaced policy effects
2. **Limited substitution** - HDB buyers can't easily switch to private housing
3. **Supply-demand imbalance** - BTO supply couldn't meet demand
4. **"Flight to safety"** - Buyers shifted from private to public housing during uncertainty





---

### 3. Lease Decay Arbitrage: Market vs Theoretical Value

**Method:** Smoothing splines fit to empirical HDB data (30-99 year leases)
**Benchmark:** Bala's Curve (Singapore Land Authority's theoretical depreciation schedule)

**Finding:** Market prices deviate **dramatically** from theoretical Bala's curve - creating arbitrage opportunities.





| Lease Years | Market Value % | Theoretical % | Arbitrage Gap | Signal | Investment Implication |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------|----------------------|
| **30 years** | 1735% | 30% | **+1705%** | **STRONG SELL** | Extremely overvalued |
| **40-50 years** | 57-97% | 40-50% | **+17-47%** | **SELL** | Overvalued, consider selling |
| **80-84 years** | 71-77% | 80-88% | **-9-17%** | **BUY** | Undervalued |
| **97-98 years** | 67-74% | 98-99% | **-25-32%** | **STRONG BUY** | Cash buyer opportunity |

**Interpretation:**
- **30-50 year leases** are in a **bubble** - trading 400-1700% above theoretical fair value
- **97-98 year leases** are a **bargain** - trading 25-32% below theoretical value
- Market **overvalues most older leases** (59% of years analyzed) vs theoretical models
- Possible explanations: Location premium, SERS expectations, behavioral bias, affordability-driven demand

## Investment Implications

### For Property Buyers

**HDB Buyers - Resilience to Policy:**
- ✅ Cooling measures don't suppress HDB prices - they may accelerate growth
- ✅ Focus on fundamentals (location, lease, town) not policy timing
- ✅ Don't panic when cooling measures announced - HDB market shows resistance
- ❌ Don't delay purchase hoping for price drops - you may miss $13K+ jumps

**Condo Buyers - Policy Risk:**
- ✅ CCR properties show 7% discounts during policy cycles
- ✅ Post-policy timing (6-12 months) can offer entry opportunities
- ❌ Expect volatility in prime segments during policy changes
- ❌ Don't overexpose to CCR (>50% of portfolio) - diversify across regions

**Lease Strategy:**
- ✅ Target 97-98 year leases (cash buyers) - 25-32% discounts
- ✅ Consider 80-84 year leases - 9-17% discounts with good value
- ❌ Avoid 30-50 year leases for investment - 400-1700% overvalued
- ❌ Don't assume old lease = cheap - 40-50 years trade at premiums

### For Property Investors

**Policy Timing Strategy:**
1. **Accumulate during policy uncertainty** - other buyers may delay, creating bargains
2. **Monitor HDB vs condo divergence** - policy effects differ by segment
3. **6-12 month post-policy window** - prime entry opportunities for condos
4. **Contrarian strategy** - buy HDB during policy panic (historically strong)

**Lease Arbitrage (Cash Buyers):**
1. **97-98 year leases** - 25-32% discounts, illiquid but high upside
2. **80-84 year leases** - 9-17% discounts, better liquidity
3. **Avoid 40-60 year leases** - 17-47% above fair value

**Regional Diversification:**
- Don't concentrate policy risk in CCR only
- OCR shows more resilience to cooling measures
- RCR intermediate - some policy sensitivity but less than CCR

### For Policymakers

**Policy Effectiveness:**
1. ✅ Cooling measures work for private housing (achieved -$138K CCR suppression)
2. ❌ Cooling measures failed for public housing (+$13K jump, +682% acceleration)
3. ⚠️ Policy spillover effects - buyers shift from private to public, creating new imbalances

**Unintended Consequences:**
- Volume surge (+26% in HDB) after cooling measures - buyers rush to transact
- Flight to quality from condos to HDB - increasing public housing demand
- Overvaluation in 30-50 year lease segment - bubble formation risks

**Recommendations:**
- Differentiate policy by property type (private vs public housing)
- Monitor lease market for arbitrage opportunities - indicates market inefficiency
- Consider supply-side measures for HDB - demand is inelastic to price shocks

## Conclusion

This causal inference analysis reveals **critical insights** for property buyers and investors in Singapore's housing market:

### Main Takeaways

**1. Policy Effects Are Heterogeneous**
- Condos: -$138K CCR suppression (policies work as intended)
- HDB: +$13K jump, +682% acceleration (policies backfire)
- **Implication:** Don't assume uniform market reaction to policy

**2. Market Deviates from Theory**
- 30-50 year leases: 400-1700% above theoretical value (bubble)
- 97-98 year leases: 25-32% below theoretical value (opportunity)
- **Implication:** Cash buyers can capture arbitrage in near-fresh leases

**3. Policy Timing Reveals Counterintuitive Effects**
- Simple DiD misses immediate price jumps and slope changes
- RDiT shows HDB prices accelerated (not cooled) post-policy
- **Implication**: Advanced methods reveal what simple analysis misses

### Key Takeaways

**For Investors:**
> Policy timing creates opportunities. Cooling measures suppressed CCR condo prices by $138K (7% discount) - but HDB prices jumped $13K when similar policies applied. Diversify across regions and property types to manage policy risk. Cash buyers can capture 25-32% discounts on 97-98 year leases through lease arbitrage.

**For First-Time Buyers:**
> HDB market shows remarkable resilience to cooling measures. Don't delay purchase hoping for price drops - HDB prices often rise after policy announcements due to strong fundamentals. Focus on town selection (Bishan, Serangoon, Toa Payoh) and lease remaining rather than policy timing.

**For Policymakers:**
> Cooling measures achieve objectives for private housing but fail for public housing. Segment-specific policies needed rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. Monitor lease arbitrage opportunities as indicators of market inefficiency. Consider supply-side measures for HDB to address inelastic demand.
